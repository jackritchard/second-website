                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek
                    φολῐ́ς,
                    "horny scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia.
                    Manis
                    comprises the four species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all
                    found
                    in Sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of
                    extinct
                    pangolin species are also known.</p>


                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals
                    with
                    this feature. They live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are
                    nocturnal,
                    and
                    their diet consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They
                    tend
                    to
                    be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they
                    raise
                    for about two years.</p>

                <h2>Poaching</h2>
                <p>Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in Chinese
                    traditional
                    medicine) and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in
                    the
                    world.As of January 2020, of the eight species of pangolin, three (Manis culionensis, M.
                    pentadactyla
                    and M.
                    javanica) are listed as critically endangered, three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and
                    Smutsia
                    gigantea) are listed as endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia temminckii) are
                    listed
                    as
                    vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of
                    Nature
